Hi, 

My name is Tigere, I am a techy from the UK but I was born in and raised in Zimbabwe.
My native language is Shona, to say hi in Shona you say 'hesi'. 

Tech is a great tool that humanity can use to solve some of our most pressing 
problems. We could solve really challenging problems if we deliberately overlooked
how much money we could make from solving the problems and thought more about how much
we could impact the world and our society positively.

How are great things achieved? by doing hard things.
